          <h2>The Root Tree</h2>
          <p>
            LuminaNexus is not a brand or a business first. It is a Tree.
            The projects, books, and experiments live as branches on that
            Tree.
          </p>

          <h3>What this place is</h3>
          <p>
            A digital sanctuary: a place to honor HaShem with creativity,
            learning, and remembrance. Stories, Kabbalistic meditations,
            stone memories, quantum dreams – all gathered here.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is intentionally small, human, and slow. No ads, no noise.
            Just light.
          </p>

          <h3>What this place is not</h3>
          <p>Not a social feed. Not a dopamine machine. Not optimized for “engagement.”</p>
          <p>
            If anything, it is optimized for returning – back to the
            Tree, back to the Source, back to the quiet voice whispering,
            <span class="hebrew-soft">שׁוּב</span> – “return.”

          <h2>Branches of the Lumina Tree</h2>
          <p>
            Each named branch is a flavor of learning, reflection, or
            practice. For now, they are a map of intention – a way of
            saying: all of this belongs to one Tree.

            Once, there was a Library of Gates: 231 paths between the 22
            letters, star-mapped across a digital sky. That dream has not
            been lost; it is only resting.

          <h3>The Library (coming back soon)</h3>
          <p>
            The Celestial Library will return as an interactive star-map

            prayer.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, it lives as intention and sketches – but the Tree
            remembers.

          <h3>Etz Chaim · The Tree of Life</h3>
          <p>
            A renewed Etz Chaim visualization – Orbs of Sefirot, paths of
