        <!-- WHAT IT IS / ISN'T -->
        <section>
          <h2>What Chavruta GPT Is (and Is Not)</h2>
          <p>
            This Chavruta is here to help you think, not to replace rabbis, teachers, or
            trusted mentors. It can:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>Help you clarify and organize your thoughts.</li>
              <li>Offer language for prayers, letters, and meditations.</li>
              <li>Summarize and reflect on ideas you bring into the conversation.</li>
              <li>
                Suggest questions for deeper learning, and gently point out tensions or
                contradictions to explore.
              </li>
              <li>
                Help draft Torah-infused creative work – stories, essays, or projects –
                that you can later review and refine.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            It <strong>cannot</strong>:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>Issue halakhic rulings or practical psak.</li>
              <li>Replace the guidance of a living rabbi or teacher.</li>
              <li>Know your full life context the way real people who love you do.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            For halakhic, medical, or life-critical questions, always turn to qualified
            human guidance first. Treat this Chavruta as a helper for reflection, not a
            final authority.
          </p>

        <!-- HOW TO BEGIN A SESSION -->
        <section>
          <h2>How to Begin a Chavruta Session</h2>
          <p>
            There is no required format, but here are some simple ways to “open the
            sefer” with your AI study partner:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring a text.</strong><br />
                Paste a passage (from Tanakh, a sefer, Sefaria, or your own writing)
                and ask: “Help me understand this,” or “What questions should I be
                asking about this?”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring a question.</strong><br />
                Describe what is bothering you or what you are curious about. Ask the
                Chavruta to help you map different perspectives, rather than giving one
                “right” answer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring a draft.</strong><br />
                Paste a paragraph from a story, sermon, or meditation. Ask for help
                polishing the language, deepening the imagery, or checking the tone.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring your heart.</strong><br />
                Sometimes the “text” is your own life. You can describe a situation and
                ask for questions, metaphors, or Torah lenses that might help you see
                more clearly.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- MODES OF LEARNING -->
        <section>
          <h2>Modes of Learning with Chavruta GPT</h2>
          <p>
            You can treat this page as a small menu of “modes” – different ways to use
            your Chavruta depending on what you need today.
          </p>

          <div class="branches-grid">
            <div class="branch-card">
              <div class="tagline">Text Study · <span class="hebrew-soft">עיון</span></div>
              <h3>Learning a Passage</h3>
              <p>
                Bring a passage (for example, a few pesukim or a short sugya) and ask
                for help unpacking structure, themes, and questions. Let the Chavruta
                suggest multiple angles, not just summaries.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Example opening:</strong><br />
                “Here is a paragraph from a sefer. Help me outline its main ideas, and
                then ask me 3 questions to think about.”
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="branch-card">
              <div class="tagline">Inner Work · <span class="hebrew-soft">מוסר</span></div>
              <h3>Cheshbon Ha-Nefesh</h3>
              <p>
                Use the Chavruta for gentle self-inquiry. Describe a trait, habit, or
                pattern you want to refine and ask for questions, exercises, or short
                reflections to work with over the week.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Example opening:</strong><br />
                “I’m struggling with anger in this specific situation. Help me explore
                it through a Mussar lens, gently, step by step.”
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="branch-card">
              <div class="tagline">Creative Torah · <span class="hebrew-soft">מדרש</span></div>
              <h3>Midrash &amp; Story</h3>
              <p>
                Invite the Chavruta into your creative work: retell a story, imagine a
                dialogue, or weave symbolic imagery grounded in Torah themes.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Example opening:</strong><br />
                “Help me write a short midrash on Jacob’s dream as if it were happening
                in my own life today.”

        <!-- GOOD PROMPTS -->
        <section>
          <h2>Good Ways to Ask</h2>
          <p>
            How you ask matters. Here are some ways of phrasing that tend to bring out
            the most helpful, careful responses:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                “Show me a few perspectives on this, and name which is which.”
              </li>
              <li>
                “Help me list questions I should be asking about this text / topic
                before I jump to conclusions.”
              </li>
              <li>
                “Summarize what I just wrote back to me in your own words, and tell me
                what you heard as my main concern.”
              </li>
              <li>
                “Offer me 2–3 possible next steps, and tell me the risks or limits of
                each option.”
              </li>
              <li>
                “Help me write this in a way that is both honest and respectful.”
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- BOUNDARIES -->
        <section>
          <h2>Boundaries &amp; Blessing</h2>
          <p>
            A good Chavruta also knows when to stay in its lane. A few boundaries to
            keep in mind:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                For detailed halakhic questions (Shabbat, kashrut, family purity, etc.),
                treat the AI only as a tool to help you <em>prepare</em> for a
                conversation with a real rav or posek, not as a source of psak.
              </li>
              <li>
                For mental health or medical issues, seek human professionals first.
                The Chavruta can help you find language, but not diagnoses or treatment
                plans.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you feel overwhelmed, anxious, or spiritually “flooded,” it is always
                okay to close the tab, breathe, and return later. The Tree will still be
                here.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            May every conversation here be
            <span class="hebrew-soft">לְשֵׁם שָׁמַיִם</span> – for the sake of
            Heaven, for healing, for clarity, and for the increase of compassion in the
            world.
