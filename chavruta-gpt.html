        <!-- WHAT IT IS / ISN'T -->
        <section>
          <h2>What Chavruta GPT Is (and Isn’t)</h2>
          <p>
            This Chavruta is here to help you think, not to replace rabbis, teachers, or
            trusted mentors. It can:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>Help you clarify and organize your thoughts.</li>
              <li>Offer language for prayers, letters, and meditations.</li>
              <li>Summarize and reflect on ideas you bring into the conversation.</li>
              <li>
                Suggest questions for deeper learning, and gently point out tensions or
                contradictions to explore.
              </li>
              <li>
                Help draft Torah-infused creative work – stories, essays, or projects –
                that you can later review and refine.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>It <strong>cannot</strong>:</p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>Issue halakhic rulings or practical psak.</li>
              <li>Replace the guidance of a living rabbi or teacher.</li>
              <li>Know your full life context the way real people who love you do.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            For halakhic, medical, or life-critical questions, always turn to qualified
            human guidance first. Treat this Chavruta as a helper for reflection, not a
            final authority.
          </p>

        <!-- HOW TO BEGIN A SESSION -->
        <section>
          <h2>How to Begin a Chavruta Session</h2>
          <p>
            There is no required formula, but here are some simple ways to “open the
            sefer” with your AI study partner:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring a text.</strong><br />
                Paste a passage (from Tanakh, a sefer, Sefaria, or your own writing)
                and ask: “Help me understand this,” or “What questions should I be
                asking about this?”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring a question.</strong><br />
                Describe what is bothering you or what you are curious about. Ask for a
                few perspectives and some good questions to sit with.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring a draft.</strong><br />
                Paste a paragraph from a story, sermon, or meditation. Ask for help
                polishing the language, deepening the imagery, or checking the tone.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring your heart.</strong><br />
                Sometimes the “text” is your own life. You can describe a situation and
                ask for questions, metaphors, or Torah lenses that might help you see
                more clearly.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- MODES -->
        <section>
          <h2>Modes of Learning</h2>
          <p>Some ways you might choose to learn on a given day:</p>

          <div class="branches-grid">
            <div class="branch-card">
              <div class="tagline">
                Text Study · <span class="hebrew-soft">עיון</span>
              </div>
              <h3>Learning a Passage</h3>
              <p>
                Bring a few pesukim, a short sugya, or a paragraph from a sefer. Ask for
                an outline, themes, and 2–3 questions to think about.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Example opening:</strong><br />
                “Here’s a short piece from a sefer. Help me outline it, then ask me three
                questions that go deeper.”
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="branch-card">

                Inner Work · <span class="hebrew-soft">מוסר</span>
              </div>
              <h3>Cheshbon Ha-Nefesh</h3>
              <p>
                Describe a trait or pattern you’re working on. Ask for gentle Mussar-style
                questions, exercises, or short daily reflections.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Example opening:</strong><br />
                “I’m struggling with anger in this situation. Help me explore it gently,
                step by step, through a Mussar lens.”
              </p>
            </div>

                Creative Torah · <span class="hebrew-soft">מדרש</span>
              </div>
              <h3>Midrash &amp; Story</h3>
              <p>
                Retell a Torah story, imagine a dialogue, or weave symbolic imagery
                grounded in Torah and your own life.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Example opening:</strong><br />
                “Help me write a short midrash on Jacob’s ladder as if it were my own
                dream tonight.”

        <!-- GOOD PROMPTS -->
        <section>
          <h2>Good Ways to Ask</h2>
          <p>
            A few patterns that tend to bring out the most helpful, careful responses:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>“Show me 2–3 perspectives on this, and name each one.”</li>
              <li>“Help me list questions I should be asking before I decide.”</li>
              <li>
                “Summarize what I just wrote back to me in your own words, and tell me
                what you hear as my main concern.”
              </li>
              <li>
                “Offer 2–3 possible next steps, and name the risks or limits of each.”
              </li>
              <li>
                “Help me phrase this in a way that is both honest and respectful.”
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- BOUNDARIES -->
        <section>
          <h2>Boundaries &amp; Blessing</h2>
          <p>
            A good chavruta also knows its limits. Remember:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                For halakhic questions, this Chavruta is a preparation tool only. Ask it
                to help you think, then take real questions to a rav or posek.
              </li>
              <li>
                For mental health or medical questions, seek human professionals. The
                Chavruta can help with language and reflection, not diagnosis or
                treatment.
              </li>
              <li>
                If at any point you feel overwhelmed or flooded, it is holy to pause.
                Close the page, breathe, come back later. The Tree will still be here.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            May every conversation here be
            <span class="hebrew-soft">לְשֵׁם שָׁמַיִם</span> – for the sake of
            Heaven, for healing, for clarity, and for the increase of compassion in the
