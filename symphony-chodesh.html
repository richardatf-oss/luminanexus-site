              Each month, at (or near) Rosh Chodesh, a short piece of music is
              generated from fundamental constants – Planck length, electron
              charge, the fine-structure constant, and others – tuned into the
              range of human hearing and offered as a small

        <!-- WHAT IT IS -->
        <section>
          <h2>What Symphony Chodesh Is</h2>
          <p>
            Symphony Chodesh is not a concert hall project. It is a quiet
            listening experiment: an attempt to translate the “fixed” aspects
            of the universe into something we can hear, softly, once a month,
            as the moon renews herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim is not scientific precision for its own sake, and not
            musical virtuosity. The aim is <em>awareness</em> – to remember
            that behind the math, behind the code, there is a Creator, and
            that even the constants can be read as a kind of psalm.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
        <section>
          <h2>How It Works · Conceptual Blueprint</h2>
          <p>
            The exact implementation will evolve, but the basic idea is to
            gently map fundamental constants into the language of sound:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Choose a small set of constants for a given month
                (for example, Planck length, electron charge,
                fine-structure constant).
              </li>
              <li>
                Normalize each constant into a range that can be mapped into
                audible frequencies (for example, 80–1200 Hz) and musical
                intervals.
              </li>
              <li>
                Treat each constant as a “voice” or “instrument”: one becomes
                a bassline, another a melody, another a slow modulation or
                drone.
              </li>
              <li>
                Let the current Hebrew month and its traditional themes
                influence the scale, mode, or rhythmic pattern.
              </li>
              <li>
                Render a short piece (a few minutes) and keep it simple and
                listenable – more like a meditation than a soundtrack.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            Over time, a quiet archive of monthly pieces can form: a year of
            constants sung once for each Rosh Chodesh.
          </p>

            This Lab of Light lives under
            <span class="hebrew-soft">עץ מים – Etz Mayim</span>, the Tree of
            Water, because it thinks of sound as a kind of flowing river:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                To let the listener feel, even for a moment, that reality is
                finely tuned and held in place by a Divine hand.
              </li>
              <li>
                To make room for awe without requiring advanced math or
                physics background.
              </li>
              <li>
                To honor Rosh Chodesh as a time of subtle renewal – a small
                song, not a loud one.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            You might listen once when the new moon arrives, or loop the piece
            softly while you learn, write, or simply breathe.

        <!-- STATUS -->

          <h2>Status &amp; Future Steps</h2>
          <p>
            Symphony Chodesh is currently in the design and prototyping
            phase. Be’ezrat HaShem, the plan is:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Design a simple script that reads constants and maps them to
                pitches and durations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Choose a small set of sound palettes (strings, soft synths,
                bells) suitable for quiet listening.
              </li>
              <li>
                Generate one short piece per month and archive them here
                under this Lab.
              </li>
              <li>
                Eventually, allow a visitor to toggle which constants they
                want to “hear,” and perhaps which mode or scale to use.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            For now, this page is a <em>kli</em> – a vessel. The music will
            grow into it.
