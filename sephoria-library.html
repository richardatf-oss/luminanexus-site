        <section>
          <h2>What the Sephoria Library Is</h2>
          <p>
            The Sephoria Library is the “catalog room” of the Celestial
            Library: a place where Sefirot, letters, and gates are arranged
            into human-sized shelves. It is not a comprehensive map of
            Kabbalah; it is a set of pointers, organized with love and
            reverence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Sefirah becomes a shelf of themes, projects, and reflections
            spread across the LuminaNexus Tree. Over time, entries here can
            link to books, apps, songs, and meditations that live on other
            branches.
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>Three threads weave this Library:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ten Sefirot – as luminous “shelves.”</li>
              <li>The twenty-two letters – as paths between shelves.</li>
              <li>
                The 231 Gates – as a dream of a future interactive star-map,
                waiting to be rebuilt.

            Below is a first map of shelves. For now, each description is a

                The unseen crown, the will-to-be. Shelf for intentions,
                vows, and the quiet “yes” beneath all projects in the Tree.
                A place for mission statements, dedications, and the first

        <section>
          <h2>Letters, Paths, and the 231 Gates</h2>
          <p>
            The Sephoria Library remembers that the Sefirot do not float
            alone. Twenty-two letters form paths between them, and those
            paths combine into the 231 Gates:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>22 letters</strong> – each a channel of sound, shape,
                and meaning.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Paths on the Tree</strong> – letters connecting one
                Sefirah-shelf to another.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>231 Gates</strong> – the dream of a star-map where
                each pair of letters becomes a luminous gate of learning.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            In the future, this page can link directly into an interactive
            Celestial Library: click a Sefirah-shelf, choose a letter-path,
            and watch as books, songs, and meditations light up that gate.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- HOW TO USE -->
        <section>
          <h2>How to Use This Library</h2>
          <p>
            For now, the Sephoria Library is a map of intention. You can
            still use it as a spiritual and creative compass:
          </p>
          <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>
                When you begin a new work, ask:
                <em>Which shelf does this belong to?</em> Keter? Chesed?
                Yesod?
              </li>
              <li>
                When you feel stuck, look for the missing Sefirah:
                <em>Do I need more Binah (structure)? More Hod (gratitude)?</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                Over time, as projects on LuminaNexus grow, links can be
                added from each shelf to specific works and pages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remember that the Tree is one: shelves are distinctions, not
                separations.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            This Library is a promise: that learning and creativity will be
            gathered, not scattered. That every spark can find a shelf, and
            every shelf can point back to the Root.
