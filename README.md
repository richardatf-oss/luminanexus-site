# LuminaNexus – The Tree that Holds Every Light

LuminaNexus is a quiet corner of the web – a digital **etz**, a Tree – where
words, song, study, and memory are gathered gently into one place.

This site is the root page of the Tree. It introduces:

- **The Root Tree** – what this place is and is not  
- **Branches of the Lumina Tree** – Etz Shalag, Etz Aven, Etz HaMareh, Etz Mayim, Etz Esh  
- **Labs of Light** – Symphony Chodesh, Mountain-to-Melody, Etz Aven · The Stone Tree, Ivrit HaOr, Chavruta Notebook  
- **Celestial Library & Etz Chaim** – the resting dream of the 231 Gates star-map  
- **Chavruta GPT** – an AI chavruta for gentle learning and reflection  

## Files

- `index.html` – the entire site, including inline styles
- (More pages and assets can grow as new branches and labs are created.)

## Deployment

The site is deployed with Netlify:

- **Build command:** _none_ (static HTML)
- **Publish directory:** `.`

Every push to this repository updates the live site at **luminanexus.org**.

If anything here is worthy, may it be a merit for all who need light.
